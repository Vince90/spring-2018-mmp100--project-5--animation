# Project 5 — Animation
For this project, you’ll create a 3-second animation that is based on either your own hand-sketched paper drawings (that you’ll scan into your computer), on modified images of your own, or that is drawn in a digital tool, such as Photoshop or Illustrator.

The source of your animation will be a sprite called `sprite.png` and it will be comprised of at least 90 frames; At 30 frames per second, this means your animation will last 3 seconds. These frames **must** be your own; no online images.

You may create a choppier animation that is longer by using fewer frames per second. You may also opt to create an animation of more than 90 frames.

Should you create a piece you feel is portfolio-worthy, then you should upload the project to your MMP server accounts, but this is optional.

## Directions
1. Add your name to the `title` element in the `head` section of `index.html`.
2. Add your animation’s name to the `h1` element of `index.html`.
3. Add your name to the `h2` element of `index.html`.
4. Replace the empty `sprite.png` file in the`img` folder with your sprite. **Do not** use any other image for your sprite.
5. Add your CSS to the `style.css` file in the `css` folder. **Do not** add CSS anywhere else in your project.
6. Use the `animation` ID in `index.html` as the container of your animation.

**Note**: *Do not* edit any file not mentioned above.

## Due Date
This is due at 10:00 AM on Thursday, 17 May 2018. **No late work will be accepted.** We’ll watch your animations during our last class on 17 May.
